# HTML_and_CSS_Refactor

There were a few changes that I made to the code to make it look cleaner. I changed the divs that contained the header and footer and nav tools to the header and footer tag respectfully. This makes finding them in the code easier. 

I also added comments in the css page using /**/ to help clarify what each class/id/style does. Again, this makes it easier to understand. 

Under the hero class, I combined two of the background tags into one for less lines of actual code.

I added alts to all the images. This is so, if the images do not load, a short description can be seen of the image.
